:x: **If you need to work with ELF file in GoLang, you must use GoLang's standard [debug/elf](https://pkg.go.dev/debug/elf) package.** :x:

Yet Another ELF reader!


This is a very basic implementation of an ELF reader with limitted functionalities focused only on linux ELF64 type. 

If you want to hack though, you can use or extend this package. Look at the [main.go](./main.go) file for an example usage.
